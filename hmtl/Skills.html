										<h2>Skills application</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I have been very fortunate to apply these skills from her previous employment in customer service, small businesses, community, training and 
									developemt as well as teaching for K12 and adult training. I also did a lot of volunteer work for 
									the community during the COVID-19 by making content for kids that help increase their handwashing awareness. </p>

										<h2>How I get things done</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I always set my mind into making a to-do list with schedule for 
									each activity that I need to do. I prioritize harder 
									task first as well as ASAP tasks.
									I get things done by focusing on each task one at a time and I make sure I am very 
									particular with the detail of my work until fruition. </p>

										<h2>Creativity</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I based my creativity in accepted theory as well as the culture of the company or school to 
										make a solution in the instructional design and development that passes their ideals. 
										I also take note the user experience by carefully looking into the demographic of the people who will need the material.
										I look into making it interactive by gamification that can be easily understood and information are retained easily as well. </p>

                                                                <article>
                                                               <header class="major">
									<h2>Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I find it very important to look at all the KPIs that are necessary 
										to be able to make a great material. Constant communication with the 
										SME's, team leader, teachers and other key people in the organization to fulfill the needs and goals for a certain project.
									The demographic of the target people will also be considered during project creation. </p>
                                                                </article>

										<h2>Design</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My way of design is always customized to the clientâ€™s needs and wants with careful thoughts using theories that are accepted on a 
									     project.   </p>
                                                                </article>

										<h2>Development</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I develop the elearning materials after carefully analyzing the KPI's of business. By using the necessary resource, 
										I integrate it in a beautifully developed learning material. This can be presented to the
									     SME's, team leader, teachers and other key people in the organization before rolling out to the target people to check 
										for validity or pilot testing. </p>
                                                                </article>

									 <header class="major">
										<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>
									</header>
									<p>With the help of my experience, I have the confidence to increase the KPI's and goals of the client using strong
										implementation per course given. In a K12 setting, constant communication to the teacher is the key in implementing the right
									 type of materials to be implemented in a class setting whether it be blended, instructor led or self paced.  </p>
